<h3><big>OBSERVATIONS</big><br />
<small>ON</small><br />
THE PRESENT STATE OF<br />
<big>THE AFFAIRS OF THE RIVER PLATE.</big></h3>


<p>The destructive war which has now been waged for so many years, by the
Chief of the Province of Buenos Ayres against the Republic of Uruguay,
involves questions of so much importance to the commercial interests,
and to the national honour of England, that nothing can account for
the very slight attention which it has received from Parliament and
the press, except the fact that many of the principal considerations
connected with it have never yet been fully brought before the British
public. In order to supply this deficiency, and to show how much it
concerns the character of this country that this war should at once be
brought to a close in the only manner in which it can be ended; that
is, by the prompt and decided interference of the Governments of
France and England, I have thought that it might be useful to lay
before the public the following observations and documents,
explanatory of the principles involved in the war; of the conduct
pursued by Mr. Mandeville, the British Minister to the Argentine
Confederation, at the most critical period of its progress; and of the
strong and rapidly-increasing interest which this country, and more
especially the port of Liverpool, has in the preservation of the
threatened independence of the Republic of Uruguay.</p>

<p>Most of the readers of these remarks are no doubt aware that the
Province of the Banda Oriental, or eastern bank of the River Plate,
was first constituted an independent state, under the title of the
Republic of Uruguay, at the close of the war between the Argentine
Confederation and the Empire of Brazil, in the year 1828. This
arrangement was in a great measure brought about by the good offices
of Lord Ponsonby, the Ambassador of the British Government to the
Court of Rio, and the result of his negociations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
was so agreeable to the English Government, that the peace thus concluded
was made a subject of congratulation in the speech from the throne in the
year 1829. The principal object in forming this new Republic was, to
put an end to the destructive war between Buenos Ayres and Brazil,
originating in the claims put forward by both these countries to the
possession of the Province of the Banda Oriental. The Brazilians, who
had had possession of it for several years, were naturally unwilling
to have so warlike and powerful a state as the Argentine Republic on
their most vulnerable frontier, and the Argentines were not less
unwilling to have the Brazilian frontier pushed more than a hundred
leagues up the River Plate, and within the limits of the ancient
Viceroyalty of Paraguay, which had for ages been occupied by the
Spanish race. As the only effectual solution of these difficulties,
the English Government proposed that the Banda Oriental should be
rendered independent of both countries, and this, after some
negociation, was agreed to by all the parties concerned.</p>

<p>The primary object of the mediation of the English Government was the
re-establishment and preservation of peace and amity between two
nations, with both of which England had valuable commercial relations;
and this object has been completely gained by the arrangement then
effected. During the sixteen years which have elapsed since the treaty
was concluded, no serious difference has occurred between Brazil and
the Argentine Confederation, nor is any likely to occur so long as the
barrier of an independent state is interposed between them. It is only
during the last two years that serious discussions have arisen between
them, and these have originated in the fears of Brazil, lest the
successes of the Buenos Ayrean army, now before Monte Video, should be
such as to break down the barrier established by the Ponsonby treaty,
and again to bring the Buenos Ayreans on the frontiers of Rio Grande.
From apprehension of this event, the Brazilian Government has allowed
General Paz, with his military staff, to pass through its territory to
place himself at the head of the Correntino insurgents, who have risen
against Rosas, and made common cause with Monte Video; it has also recalled
Admiral Grenfell, its commander in the River Plate, as well as its diplomatic
agent at Monte Video, for engaging in an ill-timed quarrel with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Monte Videan Government; and if the Buenos Ayrean
army should succeed in gaining possession of the city of Monte Video,
it will in all probability, whether backed or not by England and
France, decide to take part in the war, rather than allow General
Rosas to succeed in the designs which he now avows on the Republics of
Uruguay and Paraguay, the two bulwarks of the western provinces of the
Brazilian empire. Notwithstanding the recent victories of the
Brazilian General, Baron Caxias, over the rebels of Rio Grande d&oacute; Sul,
that province is still in a very unsettled state&mdash;far too much so to
be safely exposed to the machinations of such dangerous neighbours as
Generals Rosas and Oribe. It may, therefore, be confidently expected,
that if the great naval powers do not interpose, the progress of
events will again bring on a war between Brazil, strengthened by the
army of Uruguay, under General Rivera, that of Corrientes under
General Paz, and the forces of Paraguay on one side; and Buenos Ayres
on the other, backed by those other provinces of the Argentine
Confederation, which still follow the fortunes of General Rosas.</p>

<p>What the result of such a war would be no one can predict, but its
first consequence would be another blockade of Buenos Ayres, by the
Brazilian fleet, its next the reinforcement of the garrison of Monte
Video by a detachment of Brazilian troops, and its probable final
result, after the whole of the countries engaged in it had been
thoroughly ruined, the establishment of the ascendancy either of the
government of Buenos Ayres, or of that of Brazil at Monte Video. This
would be alike opposed to the wishes and the interests of the Monte
Videans themselves, to the interests of a large portion of South
America, and to those of the nations trading with it. A small
Independent State, like the Republic of Uruguay, governed as it has
ever been since the date of its independence on the most liberal
commercial principles, is the best of all checks on the commercial
illiberality of the neighbouring countries, and is much too valuable
to be sacrificed by the Government of any commercial nation which has
at heart the prosperity of its subjects.</p>

<p>If it should be said that neutral nations have no right to interpose
between belligerents, even for the purpose of preserving the national
independence of the weaker, I answer, that no longer since
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
than last year, the Government of this country was prepared to have interposed,
if it had been necessary, in order to preserve the independence of the
Empire of Morocco; and that the Government of France fully admitted
the right of England to do so in such a case, by giving a promise
beforehand that it would not use its victory either to conquer the
territory or to destroy the independence of the offending state. The
reason why England was prepared to resist the conquest of Morocco was,
that such a conquest would have seriously endangered her interests and
influence in the Mediterranean; and one principal reason why she
should interfere to prevent the conquest of Monte Video by the army
and squadron of Buenos Ayres is, that such a conquest would jeopardise
her valuable commerce and her influence in the River Plate, the only
outlet of regions larger than all the great Kingdoms of Western Europe
united. Brazil has the same right to interpose that Austria would have
to resist the conquest of Sardinia, or Prussia the conquest of
Belgium, by France.</p>

<p>Many advantages have resulted both to the commerce of foreign nations,
and to the prosperity of the people of Uruguay, from the recognition
of its independence both of Buenos Ayres and Brazil, which were not
anticipated at the time when it was established, the whole of which,
as we shall show, will be lost if it is allowed to be absorbed by or
placed in dependence on Buenos Ayres. Amongst these advantages are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The creation of an Independent State on the eastern bank of the River
Plate has given the commercial nations of Europe trading with those
vast countries of South America, whose only means of intercourse with
the rest of the world is through that River, a greatly increased
security against being again cut off from communication with them, as
they were during the Brazilian blockade, in the years 1825, 6, and 7.
At that time, both banks of the river were involved in the war, the
city of Monte Video being in the hands of the Brazilians, and the
Province which now forms the Republic of Uruguay being in arms against
them. The consequence of this state of things was, that the whole of
the countries watered by the great rivers Parana, Paraguay, Uruguay,
and their innumerable tributary streams, as well as the provinces of
Buenos Ayres and Monte Video,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
were cut off from all communication with Europe for nearly three years,
and that the great commerce which even then was carried on by England
and other nations with those countries, was for the time destroyed. Some
notion may be formed of the inconvenience which this country alone
sustained from the blockade of the river, from the following facts. In
the years 1822, 3, 4, and 5, the four years preceding it, the average
annual value of the exports from England to the River Plate, was
&pound;909,330, whilst in 1826, 7, and 8, during the blockade, it fell
to &pound;279,463, and in 1827, to &pound;150,000, and even that small
remnant of trade was carried on by vessels which broke the blockade. At
a subsequent period, namely, in the years 1838-9, and 40, there was
again a blockade in the River Plate, established by France, a power much
more capable of making a blockade respected than Brazil, but as the east
bank of the river was no longer under the control of Buenos Ayres, which
was the power against whom the blockade was directed, the evils
resulting from it were comparatively small. Foreign ships were still
able to proceed to Monte Video, (thanks to the independence of Uruguay),
and thus, although one line of intercourse with the interior was cut off
by the blockade of the port of Buenos Ayres, the other up the river
Uruguay was kept open. In consequence of this, the evils of the blockade
were, in a great measure, confined to the city of Buenos Ayres and its
immediate neighbourhood, for the eastern bank of the river flourished
more than ever, the communication with the interior was never closed,
and the commerce of the nations trading with those countries continued
to increase. When it is considered (and it ought never to be lost sight
of,) that the commerce of foreign nations with the whole of the central
regions of South America depends entirely on the keeping open one or
other of these lines of communication, it will be seen that it is a
matter, not merely of national but of universal importance, though in an
especial manner to England, to maintain the entire independence of Monte
Video of Buenos Ayres, so as to diminish as much as possible the danger
of both being closed at the same time and by the same political events.
We say the entire independence of Monte Video, for though the nominal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
independence of the country might be preserved, even if the Buenos
Ayrean army, under General Oribe, should get possession of the city of
Monte Video, that officer would be compelled to lean on General Rosas
for support to protect him against the majority of his fellow
countrymen, who are now in arms against him quite as much as the chiefs
of the Banda Oriental were in 1826, 7, and 8, compelled to lean on
Buenos Ayres for protection against the arms of Brazil; and to follow
the fortunes of Buenos Ayres in any war in which General Rosas might
involve himself, either with Brazil or any of the nations of Europe.
This would again be fatal to the trade of the River Plate.</p>

<p>It is not generally known, although it is very important that it
should be, that this trade amounted in 1842, including both imports
and exports, to upwards of Three Millions sterling, at the port of
Monte Video alone. It is still, however, in its infancy, and requires
nothing but a few years of peace, with the introduction of steam
navigation on the Parana, the Uruguay, and their
tributaries,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> to
give it an extension which will render it of vital importance to the
merchants and manufacturers of England. The Parana and the Paraguay,
together, are known to be navigable to Assumption, which is fifteen
hundred miles above Buenos Ayres, to vessels drawing nine feet water,
and there is every reason to believe that both those rivers might be
navigated a thousand miles higher by iron steamers, such as those
recently built at Birkenhead, by order of the East India Company, for
the navigation of the Indus and the Sutlej, the former of which, when
carrying guns and troops, draw only four feet water, the latter of
which, when loaded in the same manner, not more than two and a half.
The Uruguay is equally navigable for several hundred miles to the
Salto Chico, (the little leap), and if a short canal was cut, to turn
that rapid and the much more formidable one of the Salto
Grande,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> it
would be navigable for many hundred miles above the Falls. Several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of the tributaries of these gigantic streams are larger than the Rhine,
the Elbe, or the Tagus, and great numbers of them than the Thames or
the Mersey, and the whole of this vast net-work of waters is connected
with the still more stupendous river of the Amazons, by a short
portage to the Madeira, one of the principal tributaries of that king
of rivers. The natural products which these unrivalled lines of river
communication might be made the means of bringing to the ports on the
Rivers Plate and Amazons are varied and inexhaustible. In addition to
the large supplies of hides, wool, tallow, and provisions, which these
countries now furnish, Paraguay and Corrientes are capable of
supplying the finest timber for ship-building purposes, sugar the
growth of free labour, the best kinds of tobacco, cotton-wool,
dyewoods, drugs, the tea of Paraguay, and the precious metals from
Bolivia and the back provinces of Brazil. It is now only twenty or
thirty years since steam navigation was introduced on the Mississippi,
and the consequence of its introduction has been an extension of
cultivation and population such as the world never before saw. The
natural resources of the great valleys of the Parana, Paraguay, and
Uruguay, merely require to be developed by the same means to make
Monte Video and Buenos Ayres as flourishing as New Orleans, and to
make the commerce of the River Plate rival that of the Mississippi. It
is perhaps vain to hope that anything will induce the present Governor
of Buenos Ayres to abandon the suicidal policy which is at once
impeding the intercourse with the interior, and depriving that city of
the principal benefits of its unrivalled position, but this only
renders it the more necessary to keep open the only other course,
namely, that through the Uruguay, by which the resources of these vast
countries can be brought into activity.</p>

<p>For another of the great advantages which has resulted from the
independence of Monte Video, has been the opening of a new channel for the
commercial intercourse between Europe and the central states of South America,
in peace as well as in war; and this channel the Monte Videan Government has
laboured to improve and keep open, as zealously and as successfully as the
Buenos Ayrean Government has laboured to narrow and impede
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the old ones. The Buenos Ayrean Government has been
warned repeatedly by its warmest friends of the consequences which
would result from its illiberal commercial policy; but they might just
as well have reasoned with the winds; for, the only effect of the
contrast between the rapidly increasing prosperity of Monte Video and
the declining state of Buenos Ayres, has been to excite the most
deadly hatred and jealousy towards Monte Video on the part of the
Buenos Ayrean Government, and a settled determination to drag down
that rapidly improving city to its own level. The following sketch of
the commercial policy of the two countries will show what have been
the principal causes of the prosperity of Monte Video, and what of the
decline of Buenos Ayres; and also how strong a claim the policy of the
former gives it on the sympathy and support of this country.</p>

<p>A large portion of the revenue, both of Monte Video and of Province of
Buenos Ayres, is raised by taxes on the importation of foreign goods,
and the rate of duties is not excessive in either case. It is not on
this account that any one complains of the Buenos Ayrean Government,
but because it confines foreign commerce to the single port of Buenos
Ayres, and excludes both foreigners and foreign vessels from the other
ports of the Confederation, as strictly as the Chinese formerly
excluded them from every port except Canton. This it is able to effect
by its command over the entrance to the river Parana, the direct route
to Entre Rios, Corrientes, and the other provinces of the
Confederation. Whilst the provincial Government of Buenos Ayres thus
excludes all foreign vessels from the Parana, and as far as its
control extends from the Uruguay, it claims the right to expend the
whole of the customs' revenue raised at Buenos Ayres. The upper
provinces very naturally consider this unjust, and insist on having
either a share of the revenue collected at Buenos Ayres (somewhat on
the principle adopted amongst the states of the German Zollverein), or
on having a general Congress of all the provinces of the Confederation
to decide how the money shall be distributed. This General Rosas and
his adherents refuse, and this refusal, coupled with the equally positive
refusal of the same parties to allow foreign vessels to ascend the river,
is one principal cause of the frequent wars between the states of the
Argentine Confederation on the banks of the river and the Government of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Buenos Ayres, one of which is now raging between it and Corrientes. In
this way the commerce with the interior is continually interrupted. The
policy of the Monte Videan Government is in every respect the reverse of
this, for it not only throws open the ports of Monte Video, Maldonado,
and Colonia, on the River Plate, but those of Soriano and
Paysand&uacute;, on the Uruguay, the Yaguaron, on the Laguna Merin, and
the dry port of Taquaremb&oacute; on the Brazilian frontier to all the
world, and thus gives every part of the republic all the advantages of
foreign commerce.</p>

<p>There is a still greater difference, if it is possible, in the policy
adopted by the two governments with regard to the transit trade. At
Monte Video goods may be landed without the payment of any duty, may
be there deposited in the Custom-house stores for any length of time,
on the payment of a smaller warehouse rent than is usually paid in
Liverpool, and may be sent to any of the independent countries in the
interior, or re-shipped to foreign parts, without the payment of a
dollar. The Government goes even further than this, for it allows
goods in transit to be conveyed through the whole territory of the
Republic, with a guia or Custom-house Permit to all parts of the
frontier, and to be forwarded into the Argentine provinces of Entre
Rios and Corrientes, into the Republic of Paraguay, and into the back
provinces of the empire of Brazil, perfectly free from duty. Hence
goods are constantly forwarded up the Uruguay, instead of going to
Buenos Ayres to pay duty to General Rosas. The natural consequence of
this is, that the people of all the adjoining states have a friendly
feeling towards Monte Video. Corrientes has several times risen
against the connection with General Rosas, in support of Monte Video,
and Brazil is prepared, if necessary, to interfere to save it from his
grasp. In fact, it is quite evident that nothing but an entire change
of policy on the part of Buenos Ayres can prevent a general war
against its usurpations. The policy of Rosas with regard to goods in
transit to the Independent States of the interior is altogether
different from that of Monte Video, for, when landed at Buenos Ayres,
they pay the same duties as if they were intended for consumption
there, and not a sixpence, or what is less than a sixpence, a Buenos Ayrean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
paper dollar, is ever returned. When goods are intended for
re-exportation by sea, the difference is in appearance less, but much
the same in reality, for whilst they can be landed at Monte Video
without paying any duty, can remain there as long as the owners like,
and can then be re-exported duty free, at Buenos Ayres they cannot be
landed without paying the full duties, their owners lose all claim to
have any part of those duties returned, if they are not re-exported
within six months, and it is only with the greatest difficulty and
after waiting many months that they obtain any return at all, even if
they are exported within that time.</p>

<p>A similar contrast is also seen in the spirit in which the Governments
of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video treat the diplomatic agents of foreign
nations. Soon after the death of the Dictator Francia, the English
Government determined to send a diplomatic agent to the Republic of
Paraguay. This gentleman, Mr. Gordon, first landed at Buenos Ayres,
hoping to be allowed to proceed up the Parana to Assumption, the
capital, but he soon found that it was no part of General Rosas's
policy to allow any such communication. The consequence was, that
after remaining at Buenos Ayres for some time combatting the pretences
under which permission was refused, he found that there was no hope of
his being allowed to proceed to the seat of his mission, through the
countries subject to the dominion of General Rosas, and crossed over
to Monte Video. There he was received with every attention, and
furnished by General Rivera with a guard of honour, under whose escort
he travelled to the frontiers of Paraguay. Mr. Gordon's letter of
acknowledgement to General Rivera will be found in the Appendix, and
it would be difficult to find a stronger illustration of the opposite
spirit of the two Governments than is presented by this transaction.
Not Francia himself was ever more determined to cut off Paraguay from
communication with the rest of the world than is General Rosas, and
the key to his conduct is, that he is determined, if possible, to
reduce the people of that Republic to subjection to his authority. No
longer since than the 15th of January last, a long article appeared in
the official <i>Gazette</i> of Buenos Ayres, censuring the Governments of
Brazil and Bolivia for recognizing the independence of
Paraguay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to all these advantages arising out of the independence of
the Republic of Uruguay, it ought to be mentioned that the Government
of Monte Video has preserved an undepreciated silver currency through
all its difficulties, whilst the Buenos Ayrean Government has issued
such masses of paper without ever redeeming it, that the Buenos Ayrean
paper dollar is not worth more than 4-1/4d. at the present time. The
other states of the Argentine Confederation positively refuse to take
the Buenos Ayrean paper money, but foreign merchants are compelled to
take it, or to dispose of their goods by barter, which is seldom
possible.</p>

<p>The consequence of the liberal commercial system adopted by Monte
Video, aided by the excellence of its situation has been to raise that
city, in fourteen years, to the position of one of the first
commercial places in America, as will be seen from the following
summary of the export and import trade in 1842, the year before the
commencement of the siege:&mdash;</p>

<p>Great as this trade is, there is no reason why its future increase
should not be as rapid as its past. There are at present several millions
of cattle roving over the boundless pastures watered by the
Uruguay, the Rio Negro, the St. Lucia, and the two hundred arroyos
or rivulets which flow into them, and with a few years of peace,
this number would be doubled, or if it was found more profitable,
flocks of sheep might be introduced instead. The repeal of the
duty on foreign wool, by the Act of 1844, gives additional
encouragement to the raising of this kind of stock, and the
reduction in the duty on foreign provisions made by the tariff of
1842, would, if this country was at peace, throw a considerable
portion of the provision trade created by that reduction of duty,
and at present monopolized by the United States, into Monte
Video. Enormous quantities of meat are now wasted, which it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
might be worth while to prepare for this market, in a way suited
for the English taste.</p>

<p>Pastoral countries, such as the territory of Uruguay, New
South Wales, Van Dieman's Land, and South Africa, have this
great advantage over arable countries that their resources can be
developed much more rapidly, with a much smaller amount of
labour, and with much less capital.  This is one of the
causes of the sudden rise of the trade with Australia, and
it is also a considerable cause of the rapid development of the
prosperity of Monte Video.  Its power of producing hides,
wool, tallow, and provisions is unlimited, by any thing except the
deficient numbers of its population; and whilst on this subject, I
may mention that Monte Video is the only one of all the Republics
formed out of the ancient possessions of Spain which has been
sufficiently well governed to attract to its shores any considerable
number of emigrants from Europe. It will be seen from the
following table extracted from the books of the Custom House at
Monte Video, that not less than 33,607 emigrants arrived in that
port between November, 1835, and December, 1842:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of this large number of emigrants, 13,676, it will be seen,
were from the Basque provinces; 696 from France; 3806 from
Spain; 6789 from Genoa; 5152 from the Canary Islands; 2247
from Portugal and Brazil, and 1241 from other parts of the
world. If, as has been said by one of our greatest writers,
there is no worse sign of the condition of a country than the fact
of large masses of its subjects leaving it, surely it must be
considered an equally strong proof of the goodness of a Government
and the resources of a country when great masses of foreign
emigrants are pouring into it. In this respect, Monte Video
stands pre-eminent above all the States of America, except
those founded by the British race, and considering the limited
extent of its territory, and the short period of its independent
existence, it can scarcely be said to yield to them.</p>

<p>Having thus shown the grounds on which the Government and
people of Monte Video are entitled to the sympathies and support
of England, I shall now proceed to say a few words on the present
disastrous position of the affairs of that Republic.</p>

<p>For the last two years, the city of Monte Video has been besieged by
an army composed almost entirely of Buenos Ayrean troops, commanded by
General Manuel Oribe, the expatriated President of Uruguay, who claims
to be the legal President of the Republic, and whose avowed object is
to overturn the present Government, and to seize on supreme power for
himself, and blockaded by sea by a Buenos Ayrean squadron, commanded
by William Brown, a British subject in the pay of General Rosas. If
the army of General Oribe was composed of Monte Videans, England could
have nothing to say in this matter, as his success would be merely the
substitution of the chief of one native party for another; but this is
not the case. Oribe has neither army, fleet, nor treasures of his own,
and owes every thing to General Rosas as absolutely as if he was a
Buenos Ayrean citizen. To allow him, therefore, to get and to retain
possession of Monte Video, would be to establish the authority of
Buenos Ayres on the east bank of the river as effectually as on the
west, and this I have already shown would be most injurious to the
interests of England, of Brazil, and the other adjoining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
States, as well as to Monte Video itself, and to the upper States
of the Argentine confederation.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the wishes of General Oribe, it is evident
that he would have no chance of retaining power any longer than
he made himself agreeable to General Rosas. In the city he has
a considerable number of supporters amongst the shopkeepers and
a few amongst the merchants, but in the country, the landed
proprietors and gauchos or peasantry are all opposed to him, and
are enrolled in the armies of General Rivera, or his lieutenants.
When President, he was besieged and deposed by this class,
against which the mere townsmen can effect nothing. If he got
possession of the city, he would not be able to raise such a native
force as would sustain him. He must, therefore, retain the
Buenos Ayrean army in his pay, or he could not stir a mile from
the walls without being attacked by the army of Rivera. Hence
he would continue in a state of dependence on General Rosas for
many years, if indeed he ever became entirely independent of
him. Thus, it will be seen, that this is not a struggle to decide
whether Oribe or Rivera shall be chief of the Republic, but
whether the Republic shall remain independent or become subservient
to the will of its bitterest enemy.</p>

<p>If the will of General Rosas should thus be allowed to become
the law of Monte Video, the prosperity of that country is at an
end. A very large revenue would be required for the support of
the Buenos Ayrean mercenaries, and it is not at all unlikely that
Rosas, who confiscated the property of the whole of the Unitarian
or Centralist Party to pay the expense of a former civil war, would
insist on the repayment of the whole, or at least of a part of the
expenses of the present war, in carrying on which the finances of
Buenos Ayres have been brought to the verge of ruin. To raise
the money required for these purposes, there are only two ways;
the first, the confiscation of the property of Oribe's opponents;
the second, a great increase of the taxes on foreign imports. The
first of these measures would destroy all the best connections of
the English merchants, and ruin all the most respectable men in
the Republic, whilst the second would quite as effectually destroy
its foreign commerce.</p>

<p>It is by no means certain, however, that even the name of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
independence would long be left to Monte Video, if General Oribe
should succeed. General Rosas would, in all probability, soon
grow tired of supplying troops and money to support another
man's authority, whilst General Oribe's necessities would compel
him to submit to anything which his patron might propose, even
if he went the length of proposing the annexation of Monte Video
to Buenos Ayres, in humble imitation of the annexation of Texas
to the United States. The last letters from Monte Video state,
that Oribe has been getting together, at the Buceo, all the members
of his former Legislative Assembly, who had followed him
to Buenos Ayres or joined him there, and with their aid he
will soon form an assembly quite capable of performing any act
which it may suit his convenience to have performed. With such
materials we shall scarcely fail to have a repetition of the annexation
of Texas on the banks of the River Plate, whenever it may
suit the plans of General Rosas and the necessities of General
Oribe to effect it.</p>

<p>It is not, however, merely on grounds of policy and humanity
that England is called upon to interfere in this contest, but it is
bound to do so by the distinct pledges of assistance given by Mr.
Mandeville, the English Minister at Buenos Ayres, to the
Government of Monte Video, in the name of his own Government.
In December, 1842, at the most critical period of the war, that
gentleman formally announced, both to the Governments of Monte
Video and Buenos Ayres, that England and France had determined
to put an end to the war, and demanded that they should
both cease from hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Not content with this, he addressed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
an official letter to Senor Vidal, the Secretary of State to the
Republic of Uruguay, urging him and his Government not to relax, but
rather to redouble their efforts to resist the Buenos Ayreans, until the
arrival of the assistance which, he stated, might be expected daily from
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The letters of Mr. Mandeville
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
will be found in the appendix to this pamphlet, and it will be for the
public to decide whether promises so distinct and emphatic, accompanied
by exhortations so strong, do not justify the Government of Monte Video,
and the merchants trading with that country, in calling on the British
Government to fulfil the engagements of its representative. Indeed it is
impossible that the Government of England can allow Monte Video to be
taken and plundered, the leading men of the Republic to be murdered or
driven into exile, and the Republic itself to be annihilated, without
destroying the high reputation which England has so long possessed in
all those countries for honour and uprightness.</p>

<p>That these consequences will be justly chargeable either on the
Representative or the Government of this country, if Monte Video
should be taken, is evident from a consideration of the circumstances
under which Mr. Mandeville gave his promises and his urgent
recommendation quoted above. The letters containing them were written
in the period which intervened between the total defeat of the Monte
Videan army at Arroyo Grande, and the advance of General Oribe and the
Buenos Ayrean forces on that city. When they were given, the Monte
Videan Government was in a state of the utmost uncertainty as to
whether further resistance would not be a useless waste of human life,
and whether it could have any other effect than to render its own
position more desperate. The infantry of Rivera, the only force up to
that time available for the defence of the city was destroyed, and the
cavalry was broken, and discouraged, besides being totally useless for
the purpose of resisting a siege. Within the city were a considerable
number of Oribe's supporters, and many neutrals, including nine-tenths
of the foreign population. At this critical moment the letters of Mr.
Mandeville, given above, were written, and it is the opinion of those
who were at Monte Video at the time, that it was those letters which induced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the Government to forego all attempts at negotiation, and to
call upon the whole population to rise and resist to the last. With
this view, besides calling on those classes of the people which had
previously taken part in the struggle, to rally round the Government,
it declared all the negro slaves in the Republic free, and formed them
into regiments of infantry for the defence of the capital, and it also
gave every encouragement to the foreign population which had emigrated
for the purpose of following the pursuits of peaceful industry, to
take up arms. By these means, an army of some thousand men was formed
within the city, chiefly from classes not before compromised, whilst
in the open country, the landed proprietors and peasantry, were
encouraged to take arms again under the command of their favourite
chief Rivera. Thus the war was renewed, and the whole population of
the Republic was again engaged in a struggle which, from the great
disproportion of the forces, nothing but the promised intervention of
England and France can bring to a close which will not be fatal to
them.</p>

<p>My object in referring to these facts is not to excite odium against
Mr. Mandeville, who could have had no object in making the promises
contained in his letters of the 28th December and 12th of January,
except that of preserving the independence of Monte Video, until the
forces which he expected from Europe had arrived. In a previous
letter, quoted in the Appendix, he positively refused to give any such
promises without the permission of his own Government; and in his
letter of the 12th of January he bases his promises of aid to the
Monte Videan Government on this assertion:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">The Interview between the
British Ambassador</span> (at Paris) <span class="smcap">and Guizot took place on the 9th
September, when he agreed to all that Lord Cowley proposed of uniting
their forces to put an end to the war.</span>" I will not suppose, even for
the sake of argument, that an English Minister made such a statement
as the above without believing it to be true, still less that he made
it for the sake of exciting fallacious and unfounded hopes in the
minds of men struggling for existence. He must have believed his own
assertions, and he must have had some strong, if not conclusive
reasons for believing them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>It is just as little my wish to cast odium on the English Government
as on Mr. Mandeville. Its foreign policy in other parts
of the world has been wise, dignified, and honest, and all that
is asked is that it will act on the same principles in this transaction.
No one can doubt that it is sincerely desirous of restoring
peace in the River Plate. The reason which Sir Robert Peel gives
for the non-fulfilment of Mr. Mandeville's promises is that he had
exceeded his orders in giving them. That there was a mistake
somewhere or other cannot be doubted, though whether it arose
from want of explicitness in the directions given to Mr. Mandeville
or from want of comprehension on his part no one is in a position
to decide, except those who have seen them. What, however,
is perfectly clear is this, that the promises given by him to the
Monte Videan Government and the assurances given by him to
his own countrymen have had a most important influence on their
conduct, and have so far compromised the British Government as
to add greatly to the other many and strong reasons for interposing.
It is no longer a question of whether an independent Government,
formed under the mediation of England shall be sacrificed, and
along with it the peace which it has so long been the means of
preserving between two of the most important states of South
America, neither is it a mere question of whether the commercial
intercourse with the finest regions of that great continent shall be
carried on without impediment; it is not now even a question of
whether a friendly Government shall be destroyed and all connected
with it ruined; these considerations, great as they are, yield to the
consideration that the honour of this country has been pledged by
its authorized representative, and that promises have been given
which cannot be violated without deep disgrace to the hitherto
unsullied honour of the English name.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span>&mdash;Since the above observations were written, explanations
have been given by the Prime Minister in Parliament which encourage us
to hope that her Majesty's Ministers have at last decided to fulfil
the promises made by their late representative Mr. Mandeville, by taking
effectual steps to terminate the war, and to secure the independence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Republic of Uruguay. They have only to speak the
word, and to make such a display of force as will show that they are
in earnest, and Monte Video is saved. Admiral Brown, or as Commodore
Purvis calls him, "Mr. Brown, the British subject, commanding the
Buenos Ayrean squadron before Monte Video," will never run the double
risk of being sunk by an English broadside, or of being hung as a
traitor by resisting the orders of his own Government, if he is
convinced that his Government means to be obeyed, and the moment that
he strikes his flag, Oribe will have nothing left but to make the best
terms for himself and his army. He draws all his provisions from the
fleet, and must retire when his supplies are cut off.</p>

<p>Within the last few days information has been received from Buenos
Ayres strongly confirmatory of some of the views stated above.
According to letters from that city of the 7th February, the
Governments of Brazil and Paraguay have formed a treaty offensive and
defensive, in which they stipulate for the freedom of the rivers
flowing through the territories of both. This is a movement of the
greatest commercial as well as political importance, and if the
independence of Monte Video is preserved, there can be no doubt that
it will join this league, and that the line of communication with the
interior of South America up the River Uruguay will be kept open, even
if General Rosas should persist in his illegal anti-social policy of
closing the Parana against foreign nations.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, December 16th, 1842.</i></p>

<p>The Governments of England and France having determined to adopt such
measures as they may consider necessary to put an end to the
hostilities between the Republics of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video, the
undersigned Minister Plenipotentiary of her Britannic Majesty to the
Argentine Confederation, has the honour, conformably to the
instructions received from his Government, to inform H. E. M. Arana,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Government of Buenos Ayres, that
the sanguinary war at present carried on between the Government of
Buenos Ayres and that of Monte Video, must cease, for the interests of
humanity and of the British and French subjects, and other Foreigners
who are residing in the country which is now the seat of war; and
therefore requires of the Government of Buenos Ayres:&mdash;1. The
immediate cessation of hostilities between the troops of the Argentine
Confederation and those of the Republic of Uruguay. 2. That the
troops of the Argentine Confederation (it being understood that those
of the Republic of the Uruguay will adopt a similar course) remain
within their respective territories, or return to them in case they
should have passed their frontier.&mdash;The undersigned requests H. E. to
reply as soon as he conveniently can, whether it is the intention of
the Government of Buenos Ayres to accede to these demands, and has the
honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, December 28th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;I received this morning your private letter of
the 20th; after thanking you for it I have little to add, except that Count de
Lurde and I have received an answer to our note demanding an armistice,
stating that a demand of this nature, menacing as it does the Argentine Confederation,
requires time for deliberation before a reply can be given. In the
mean time, I trust that the step which I and the French Minister have taken
will in no manner weaken, but, on the contrary, hasten and encourage the
zealous efforts of your Government to resist invasion, because, where winds and
waves are concerned, no man can say, when he leaves Europe, in what week or
in what month he will arrive at Monte Video. I know nothing of the operations
of the armies on either side of the Uruguay; I thank you for the information
which you send me about them; I know nothing from any other source.</p>

<p>Believe me ever, my dear M. de Vidal, ever your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>To his Excellency M. de Vidal, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, January 12th, 1843.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;When I received M. Gelly's official letter upon
the entry of Oribe's troops into the Banda Oriental, I was myself too
unwell to thank you for your letter of the 28th ult. on the subject of
your resignation, and too sad and discouraged by it at the idea of
your retirement from office at the present moment. But now when I see,
by the <i>Nacional</i> of the 3d, that you have nobly decided upon still
retaining the foreign and home departments, I am as anxious to
congratulate you and your country upon this resolution, as I was
averse, on the day I wrote to M. Gelly, to take up my pen for any body
or any thing, but for this letter of yours above mentioned. The two
official communications, which I send you with this opportunity, would
have gone with my letter to M. Gelly, luckily, it's of little
consequence whether you receive them now or this day month. What has
prevented the British and French naval forces from coming long before
this to the River Plate, I can have no conception. The interview
between the British Ambassador and Guizot took place on the 9th
September, when he agreed to all that Lord Cowley proposed, of uniting
their forces to put an end to the war. Before the end of December I
would have sworn that they would have been here. I cannot conclude my
letter without expressing to you my truest thanks for the expression
of your friendship towards me, and my confidence that, happen what
may, you will always duly appreciate my public and private conduct to
you. Believe me, my dear M. de Vidal, that my sentiments and my utmost
efforts will always be in unison to draw closer the ties of
friendship, which have been so happily established, through you in
great part, between the two countries where we first drew our breath,
and my labour will be unceasing to preserve them unchanged.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, May 26th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;I have received your official letter
of the 20th May, with the enclosure which you have had the
goodness and frankness to communicate to me,&mdash;and also the two
private letters of the same date, which you have done me the
honour to write to me.</p>

<p>I beg you to believe that I share with you all the disagreeableness
of the suspense which the silence of the British Government
to my despatches of the 4th December last causes to us both. To me
it is only a matter of a little personal inconvenience that I ought not,
nor do I, regard; to you it is very different&mdash;and all that I can
say to you on the subject is, that the moment that I hear from
England respecting it, I will not lose a moment in communicating
it to you&mdash;of this be assured, as of the sincere esteem and consideration
with which I remain,</p>

<p class="center">My dear M. de Vidal, always truly yours,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>


<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h4>(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, June 8th,1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;Although I have not received any
official answer to the proposals which I transmitted by your
Excellency's desire to her Majesty's Government, on the 6th of
December last, as a basis for the conclusion of a Treaty of Amity
and Commerce with the Republic of the Uruguay, I am led to
believe and know that they will not be accepted, for the reasons
which I stated to your Excellency at the time these proposals
were made to me&mdash;namely, that the acceptance of this offer would
be at variance with the policy and practice of her Majesty's
Government, whose wish, in matters of commerce, is to stand
on the same footing as other nations, and to enjoy no advantages
but such as would, upon similar terms, be conceded to any other
friendly power, and that accordingly her Majesty's Government
have no intention of availing themselves of this proposal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>I therefore again most pressingly renew, to your Excellency,
the proposals I made when I first had the honour to see your
Excellency, to negociate with me a Treaty of Amity, Commerce,
and Navigation, upon the basis which was presented to the Monte
Videan Government by Mr. Hamilton, in the year 1835, and
brought forward by me at a later period.</p>

<p>I am enabled to assure your Excellency that Her Majesty's
Government is not indifferent to the welfare and prosperity of the
Republic of the Uruguay, as your Excellency will shortly see by
the measures which will be taken for its preservation, and to which
I am sure you will be a willing party, and I beg your Excellency
to believe that nothing will strengthen these good intentions on
the part of Her Majesty's Government so much as a frank and
cordial acceptance of the terms of the above mentioned Treaty.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be with the highest consideration, Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your Excellency's obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>To his Excellency, Don Jose Antonino Vidal, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></p>

<h4>(MOST CONFIDENTIAL.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, June 10th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;My Government has seen with
regret that the results of my visits to Monte Video, in December
and January last, was not concession of a Treaty of Amity, Commerce
and Navigation between Great Britain and the Republic of
Uruguay upon the footing proposed by my predecessor Mr.
Hamilton, and subsequently by me, and I have been represented
as not having been sufficiently urgent with your Excellency to
conclude this treaty with me, and I have been blamed in
consequence.</p>

<p>I therefore appeal to your Excellency if I did not do my
utmost to induce you to negociate it with me, observing, that
once concluded, it would not prejudice the acceptance of any other
additional proposal on your part which might be added to it
afterwards and form additional articles&mdash;and that I only desisted
from urging it upon you, when I saw that my solicitations were of
no avail, and you were resolved to await the answer to the proposition
which I transmitted to London by your Excellency's desire.</p>

<p>I am anxious that this circumstance should be put in its true
light, and that I may be exonerated from an undeserved censure&mdash;and
still more that your Excellency should commence the negociations
of the treaty with me, which would be the best answer to the
reports of the lukewarmness of my wishes in this business.</p>

<p>Believe me to be, my dear M. de Vidal, with great truth and
regard, most sincerely and faithfully yours,</p>

<h4>(SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, June 18th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;The measures which I alluded to in
my private letter to your Excellency of the 10th instant&mdash;that her
Majesty's Government will take for the effectual protection of the
Republic of Uruguay are a joint mediation of Great Britain and
France, which I am formally to tender to the Buenos Ayrean
Government, upon the arrival of the French Minister here, Baron
de Lurde, to adjust the difference between Monte Video and
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>I did not acquaint you of this important intelligence in my
last letters, on account of the possibility of their falling into other
hands; and as I am not to make the formal offer of joint mediation
of Great Britain and France, until the arrival of the French
Minister at Buenos Ayres, I think, for many reasons, which I am
sure you will share with me, that it should not be made known;
but I have taken the first safe opportunity of communicating it to
you, for your own satisfaction and for that of your colleagues.</p>

<p>Believe me always, my dear M. de Vidal, with great regard
and esteem, most faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, June 23d,1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have had the honour to receive your Excellency's
dispatch, marked confidential, of the 18th instant, in answer to
mine of the 8th, which was delivered to me this morning, the
contents of which will cause great satisfaction to her Majesty's
Government, as to me they have procured the highest gratification.
Her Majesty's Ministers will see, in the determination of the
Monte Videan Government to conclude a Treaty of Amity, Commerce,
and Navigation, with Great Britain, on the terms proposed
by Mr. Hamilton and by me, the most unequivocal proof of the
loyalty of its intentions towards the British Empire, and of its
friendly sentiments towards her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>I shall, in consequence, avail myself of the friendly dispositions of
the Monte Videan Government for the adjustment and conclusion of the
treaty which your Excellency has done me the honour to communicate to
me, and I propose, in a few days, to embark for Monte Video, for the
termination of so honourable and desirable an event.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your Excellency's obedient humble servant,</p>

<h4>(PRIVATE.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, June 24th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;I have received your two most
amiable and friendly letters of the 18th and 20th instant; it is
needless for me to tell you the delight and gratification which
they have procured to me.</p>

<p>I have little more to add to my acknowledgement of the receipt
of these letters, as I shall so very soon have, God willing, the
satisfaction of seeing you, except to renew to my heartfelt thanks
for their contents, which only serve to increase the sentiments of
friendship and esteem which your conduct to me has inspired me
with, since the first day of our personal acquaintance.</p>

<p>I reserve all communications upon any other subject until we
meet, which will be about the middle of next week, but rely upon
it, and it is with pride I tell you, <i>you and your Government will
be satisfied</i>.</p>

<p>Believe me ever, my dear M. de Vidal, with the highest regard
and consideration,</p>

<p class="center">Most faithfully yours,</p>

<h4>(CONFIDENTIAL.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, June 25th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;Would you have any objections to
have the treaty copied immediately?</p>

<p>I have motives so strong not for coming back to Buenos Ayres,
but for being able to return at the moment when it becomes
necessary, that I should impart them to you, which I cannot well
by this conveyance.</p>

<p>I will answer for your concurrence with me in this desire to be
ready, at a moment's notice, to come back here.</p>

<p>Another motive, which is a very secondary one, and that is,
having no steward at this moment, the one who was with me for
six years having left me to set up a coffee-house. I cannot bring
my establishment with me, even if I had a house to go to at Monte
Video, and therefore I am obliged to live at the Consul's, which
is a great inconvenience to him, and consequently very disagreeable
to me; but, as I have said, this is a trifling consideration, which
may be got over very easily. Again, Mr. Hood may come by the
next packet&mdash;where shall I go then?</p>

<p>All these considerations, put together, make me very anxious,
not so much to get through the treaty, for the sake of concluding
it, as to be ready, when circumstances require my departure, to
come back here.</p>

<p class="center">Ever, my dear M. de Vidal, your faithful and sincere friend,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>


<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<h4>(PRIVATE.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, August 18th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;I had the greatest pleasure in receiving your
friendly letter, without date, which was accompanied by an official
note brought to me by M. le Comte de Lurde, to which you require an
answer.</p>

<p>If you will weigh the contents of this note, you will find that
it is impossible that I can answer it in any other way, than has
done the French Plenipotentiary by that of acknowledging the
receipt of it.</p>

<p>In the first place, no formal tender of mediation has as yet
been made by the French Plenipotentiary and me, and therefore,
until it has been positively refused, it would be as unusual as it
would be impolitic to have recourse to threats to enforce the
acceptance of it. But other and more powerful reasons forbid
this line of conduct; you who are accustomed to give directions
to your foreign Ministers and agents, know that they must act by
their instructions, and by their instructions alone. I cannot take
upon myself to say what means are at the disposal of the Comte
de Lurde, but I know I have no more the power of constraining
General Rosas to pay respect to the wishes of the mediatory
powers, as far as physical force goes than you have.</p>

<p>If I were to ask the British naval officer on this station to
land his men and garrison Monte Video, or prevent any power
blockading the port, (which in my opinion, you may rely upon it,
will never be done by General Rosas), he would laugh at me, unless
I could show that I had positive orders from my Government to
require it of him.</p>

<p>To make a declaration to this effect to General Rosas, without
having the means of carrying it into execution, would be only
exposing myself to ridicule, and my future communications to this
Government as unworthy of belief.</p>

<p>And as it is unnecessary, unless you require it, that I
should put these reasons, for not acceding to what you demand,
in an official note, I have answered it word for word, as the Comte
de Lurde has informed me he has done, by simply acknowledging
the receipt of it, thus privately stating to you my reasons for so
doing.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear M. de Vidal, always and faithfully,</p>

<p class="center">Your sincere Friend,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<h4>(PRIVATE.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, August 25th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;I have to thank you for your letter of
the 15th instant, and for the information you gave me in it with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
regard to Ellauri's proceedings in London, and to the assurances
made to him by Lord Aberdeen of his determination to put an
end to the war. His, M. Ellauri's project of a treaty rather
surprises me, considering that he was unauthorized by you to
propose it, but I suppose Republican Ministers take upon themselves
a little more in their negotiations than we Ministers of
Monarchs, at all events I hope that they will send me an outline
of it from the Foreign Office, as I am very anxious to see what
M. Ellauri would have liked to have had.</p>

<p>You may rely upon it, my dear M. de Vidal, that in spite of
all your opposers and enemies may say, your confidence in the
mediation has not been vain and groundless: Count de Lurde and
I are determined to uphold the respectability of the mediation,
but we must wait until it be rejected before other measures can
be taken.</p>

<p>Yesterday the mediation was formally proposed by M. de Lurde, and by
me to Don Felipe de Arana on the part of our respective Sovereigns,
and supported by arguments which seemed to make an impression on the
Minister. He, of course, could give neither answer nor opinion upon
the proposal, and I do not think it very likely that we shall obtain
one before the departure of the packet which is fixed for the day
after to-morrow.</p>

<p>The picture you give me of the state of your armies in Entre Rios,
leaves you little to apprehend.&mdash;A private letter from a friend of
mine in the Foreign Office says, "By the accounts from Monte Video, we
expect to receive by the next packet a demand from the Buenos Ayrean
Government to defend it from the troops of General Rivera."</p>

<p>Be assured, my dear M. de Vidal, that I will leave no opportunity
neglected to write to you whenever I have any thing to communicate
worth your knowing, and that I am always,</p>

<p class="center">Your sincere and faithful Friend,</p>

<p class="author">J. H. MANDEVILLE.</p>

24th. I really have not time to do more than thank you for it by this opportunity.</p>

<h4>(PRIVATE.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, October 19th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;I received by the last packet a
letter from Mr. Hood, a part of which I will communicate to you,
as I think it right that you should be literally and truly informed
of what is going at the Foreign Office, in London, between Lord
Aberdeen and M. Ellauri, on the subject of negociation, with
respect to a treaty of commerce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hood says "I am employed modifying the treaty and
talking Ellauri into acquiescence to our views. Yesterday,
(August 2nd), we had an interview with Lord Canning, and
during it I heard that he said he would not hesitate to sign the
treaty as now prepared. If it should come to a bargain, I think
it may be very likely that the Foreign Office may wish me to
take it out to get ratified."</p>

<p>Now, my dear friend, tell me, if you can, how is it possible for
M. Ellauri to sign and conclude a treaty, or even to say that he
will, unless he has full powers to do so? I am confident that he
has neither one nor the other, because you told me he has not,
but still it is so very extraordinary his whole conduct that I should
like if possible to have it explained.</p>

<p>I had a discourse the other day with a gentleman on the right
of the Government of the Republic of Uruguay and this country,
to expel any foreigner from their territory, at their pleasure. I
know that it is never done but under very grave circumstances;
but what I contended for was, the power and the right they
possess to do so.</p>

<p>I suppose you have not written to me lately because I did
not answer your letter of the 20th ult., but if you have no other,
it does not resemble you. Always, my dear M. de Vidal,</p>

<p class="center">Sincerely yours,</p>

<h4>(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, October 20th, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;I have not before acknowledged
the receipt of your letter of the 20th of last month, for until now
I have had nothing to communicate to you that was worth the
trouble of taking your time to read.</p>

<p>I am greatly pained by the sad termination of Count de
Lurde's and my most strenuous efforts, as far as argument and
persuasion could go, to induce the Buenos Ayrean Government to
listen to the dictates of sound policy as well as of humanity and
accept the mediation of Great Britain and France to put an end
to the war. It will grievously disappoint the great expectations
of her Majesty's Government, but for which disappointment from
my previous dispatches they will be, in a great measure, prepared.</p>

<p>I have set Messrs. Ball and Diehl to work to copy the
answer, that no time may be lost in communicating it to you,
and I shall send down the Cockatrice with it the moment it is
done.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear M. de Vidal,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>P.S.&mdash;Although I transmit this document to you officially,
as I feel it my duty to do, I would rather that it be not published
until we have the resolution of the Sala. In Europe, these papers
are never published until some time after they have been delivered,
which we consider as by far the best mode of conduct.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, October 26th, 1842</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal,</span>&mdash;Neither you nor I were, nor could
be surprised at the wretchedness of our negociation, or rather of
M. de Lurde's and my attempt to make this Government accept
the mediation of Great Britain and France, to put an end to the
war, and I am happy to think that when I was last at Monte
Video, I prepared her Majesty's Government for this result.</p>

<p>I feel the greatest pleasure to find that my unceasing efforts to
obtain the acceptance by the Buenos Ayrean Government of our
joint mediation have satisfied you. I can conscientiously say that
I have done every thing in my power to make it succeed.</p>

<p>Of course I never meant but that the note should be immediately
communicated to the Government, all I requested, and in
which I was sure your own discernment and good feelings would
make you concur in, was, that it should not be published until it
has come out here.</p>

<p>I observe, in all your letters, you write <i>mediation</i> for mediators,
as applicable to my expressions.</p>

<p>"My words in one of my preceding letters were, that your
reliance on the mediators should not be vain or unfounded."
This you have seen and can rely upon. I never hoped or gave you
reason to hope that the mediation would be successful, but the
results, according to my opinion and belief, (I am no prophet to
predict), will not be vain nor illusory. The feelings of the British
Government (and as you tell me Lord Aberdeen has himself
said) towards the Banda Oriental will be very different since the
conclusion of a treaty between it and great Britain to what they
were before.</p>

departure of the packet, to answer your private letter of the 24th
ult., and now keep my promise made to you in my letter of the
25th ult., of replying to it.</p>

<p>I must first begin by telling you that, some days before the
packet sailed, Count de Lurde and I made the formal tender of
the mediation in the manner presented to me by my instructions
with which I made you acquainted when I was last at Monte Video.</p>

<p>I told M. de Arana that he was doubtless acquainted with the
object of our visit, to which he assented, of which he had been
informed by previous conversations which he had with me, and
which was no longer a secret, for it had formed articles in the
Monte Video newspapers, and the topic of conversation in the
streets of that Town for weeks. But public or private the object
is the same, one of the greatest importance to this country and of
serious consideration to Great Britain and to France,&mdash;that of
urging General Rosas to accept the mediation of France and
Great Britain, of which the Count de Lurde and I then made the
formal offer to the Buenos Ayrean Government in order to put an
end to the deplorable conflict in which Buenos Ayres and Monte
Video have for such a length of time been engaged. <i>That Monte
Video to my knowledge is anxious and willing to make peace</i> with
Buenos Ayres upon fair and reasonable terms, and I could produce
authority for what I advanced, if required, that the proposal
which General Rosas had formerly made, of accepting the mediation
of Great Britain upon the condition that General Oribe should
be returned to power, was inadmissible, and that it was obviously
impossible that either the British or French Governments could
sanction, by their mediation, the desire of General Rosas to place
in the Presidency of Monte Video <i>a particular individual</i>, who,
however meritorious in other respects, may not be acceptable to
the majority of the inhabitants of the Oriental State, and that
those Governments can only agree to offer to either of the
belligerent powers such conditions as one independent State can,
consistently with its honour, accept from another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>I then acquainted his excellency that it was the confident expectation
of her Majesty's Government that the Argentine Government
will accept the offer of Great Britain and France to mediate
between Buenos Ayres and Monte Video, upon just and reasonable
conditions, and that the Buenos Ayrean Government will authorize
us, the Count de Lurde and me, to propose moderate and honourable
terms of peace to the Government of the Republic of the
Uruguay. I stated to M. de Arana that this offer is dictated by
the feelings of humanity and of warm interest in the prosperity of
the two neighbouring Republics, and her Majesty's Government
earnestly hope, as M. de Lurde said does that of France, that the
Government of Buenos Ayres will maturely reflect before they
reject the friendly intervention which is now offered to them by
two such powerful states, and I concluded by conjuring his Excellency
to use his whole influence with General Rosas, as his friend
and adviser, to accept the offer of mediation in the manner just
proposed to him.</p>

<p>M. de Arana replied, that of course we could not expect from
him any other answer than that he would hasten to lay the object
of the communication we had just made to him before General
Rosas, which he would do on that evening, and addressing himself
to M. de Lurde, he said, you know the answer which was addressed
to the British Minister last year, a copy of it having been given to
M. de Becourt. Neither the French Minister nor myself were
anxious to recur to that answer nor to discuss it, but he joined
with me in soliciting the good offices of M. de Arana to obtain a
happy issue to our joint offer. M. de Lurde said, and with
reason, that it would be of the greatest importance to obtain the
acquiescence of General Rosas to the mediation as soon as possible,
in which I joined him in pressing terms. M. de Arana immediately
replied that he would render an account to the Governor
of the earnest desire of the two Ministers with all the interest that
demands an affair as delicate as it is important.</p>

<p>With this last observation of M. de Arana the conference
ended, and we took leave full in hope that General Rosas, with the
soundness of his judgment and the generosity of his disposition,
aided by his Excellency's influence and good offices will not
hesitate to accept the offer of Great Britain and France to terminate
a war which, for the sake of humanity and the prosperity of
the two Republics, is so earnestly desired by all Europe, as well as
by the people and Government of Monte Video, who ask only for
peace, and the power the most legitimate in the world, that of
choosing its own rulers, and its form of government themselves.</p>

<p>Two days after the packet sailed we, the Count de Lurde and
I, called upon M. de Arana; he told us that in a question of such
great importance, as is the joint offer of mediation of Great Britain
and France, it should, he thought be communicated in writing,
and he asked us if we had any objection to make it in that manner,
I said by no means, and the French Minister and I sent in a note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
on the following day, 30th August, beginning with "In consequence
of your Excellency's desire to have the communication we
verbally made to you on the 24th instant, committed to writing,
we have the honour, &amp;c., &amp;c., and I repeated in writing word for
word what I had said to him verbally, and the French Minister
did the same. You have now, dear M. de Vidal, a faithful and
exact account of every thing that has taken place in this important
business.</p>

<p>Now as to what you ask of me with respect to answering the
official note you sent to me by the French Minister, I agree with
you perfectly, that Her Majesty's Government would not make a
second offer of its mediation, without being resolved to support it,
more especially since you say that Lord Aberdeen has declared to
M. Ellauri, that he will put a stop to the war.</p>

<p>But this assurance on the part of Lord Aberdeen does not
give me the power either to take measures for carrying this
declaration into effect, or to make such a declaration to General
Rosas. I <i>must wait</i> for instructions from my Government <i>before</i>
I inform the Buenos Ayrean Government what they will direct
shall be done, as it is not for me to say in what manner the war
shall be put a stop to.</p>

<p>M. de Lurde, when I spoke to him about the purport of the
official note to me from you, of which he was the bearer, told me
that he had simply acknowledged the receipt of it, because he
could give no other answer, and I feel that I am in exactly a
similar position.</p>

<p>You are now, as you have always been, in possession of my
public and private sentiments upon this most important question,
the mediation, and you may be most confident that my conduct
upon it, whilst it is pending, will be as satisfactory to your
Government as to yourself.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear M. de Vidal, always your faithful and
sincere friend,</p>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, December 23rd, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;I received this morning your private
letter of the 20th,&mdash;after thanking you for it, I have little to
add, except that Count de Lurde and I have received an answer
to our note, demanding an armistice, stating that a demand of
this nature, menacing as it does the Argentine Confederation,
requires time for consideration before a reply can be given.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I trust that the step which I and the French
Minister have taken will in no manner weaken, but, on the contrary,
hasten and encourage the zealous efforts of your Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to resist invasion, because, where winds and waves are concerned,
no man can say, when he leaves Europe, in what week or in what
month he will arrive at Monte Video.</p>

<p>I know nothing of the operations of the armies on either side
of the Uruguay; I thank you for the information which you send
me about them&mdash;I know nothing from any other source.</p>

<p>Believe me ever, my dear M. de Vidal,</p>

<h4>(CONFIDENTIAL.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, 24th December, 1842.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;I took the liberty, when I sent you a copy of
our note to this Government, demanding a cessation of hostilities, to
beg the favour of you not to make it public. Communications of this
nature are not intended at the time to be made public.</p>

<p>If I had intended that Mr. Dale should have a copy of it, I would have
sent one to him; but copies have been given&mdash;for the commander of the
Fantome has written a letter to me of complaint, that I had not
communicated the circumstance to him, when some one had shown him a
copy which he had read.</p>

<p>People sometimes think that by giving publicity to a document they
bind down more the persons who have signed it to their engagement;
this is a mistake. The only result which comes out of it is, that it
makes them much more cautious and reserved in future in communicating
them.</p>

<h4>(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, January 12th, 1843.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;My thanks for your letter of the 28th ult. in
answer to mine of the complaints of the captain of the Fantome. It was
perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>I have received a despatch from Lord Aberdeen, acquainting me that the
Vidal and Ellauri treaties are under the consideration of her
Majesty's Government, and that he will not fail by next packet to
communicate to me the result of their deliberations.</p>

<p>The under Secretary of State writes me that the latter is in some
measure preferred, and, therefore, it is right for me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> mention this
circumstance to you, in order that you may not be unprepared, should
it be adopted.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear M. de Vidal, ever your sincere Friend,</p>

<h4>(PRIVATE.)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Buenos Ayres, January 12th, 1843.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear M. de Vidal</span>,&mdash;When I received M. Gelly's official letter, upon
the entry of Oribe's troops into the Banda Oriental, I was myself too
unwell to thank you for your letter of the 28th ult. on the subject of
your resignation, and too sad and discouraged by it at the idea of
your retirement from office at the present moment. But now I see by
the <i>Nacional</i> of the 3rd that you have nobly decided upon still
retaining the Foreign and Home Departments, I am as anxious to
congratulate you and your country upon this resolution, as I was
averse on the day I wrote to M. Gelly to take up my pen for any body
or any thing, but for this letter of yours above mentioned. The two
official communications which I send you by this opportunity, would
have gone with my letter to M. Gelly, luckily, its of little
consequence whether you receive them now or this day month.</p>

<p>What has prevented the British and French naval forces
from coming long before this to the River Plate, I can have no
conception. The interview between the British Ambassador
and Guizot took place on the 9th September, when he agreed
to all that Lord Cowley proposed of uniting their forces to put
an end to the war. Before the end of December, I would have
sworn that they would have been here. I cannot conclude
my letter without expressing to you my truest thanks for the
expression of your friendship towards me,&mdash;and my confidence
that, happen what may, you will always duly appreciate my
public and private conduct to you.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear M. de Vidal, that my sentiments and
my utmost efforts will always be in unison to draw closer
the ties of friendship which have been so happily established,
through you in great part, between the two countries where
we first drew our breath, and my labour will be unceasing to
preserve them unchanged.</p>

<h4>MR. GORDON'S LETTER TO GENERAL RIVERA.</h4>

<p class="author"><i>Ytapua, September 26th, 1842.</i></p>

<p>Having arrived safely at this town on the 20th instant, I forwarded,
on the same evening, a despatch to the Government of this Republic
with my passports soliciting the necessary license for myself and my
companions to continue our journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> to Assumption. By the same
opportunity I forwarded to the Consuls of the Republic the despatch
with which I was charged by your Excellency.</p>

<p>The answer from the Consuls reached me yesterday afternoon, and with
it I have received, for my own person, my two companions and servant,
permission to proceed to the capital, with the assurance that every
assistance and protection will be afforded me. I regret having to add
that this license is not extended to the Oriental escort, under whose
protection and with whose assistance I have been able so fortunately
to complete my journey to the Paraguay territory&mdash;for the reason (in
the words of the Consuls note) of the said escort <i>being no longer
necessary</i>.</p>

<p>On this account the Government of this Republic has granted a
passport, which Don Blas Acevedo takes with him, ordering the Paraguay
authorities to render to this officer and to the men under his command
every necessary assistance on his return to the camp of your
Excellency, and has also forwarded the despatch which I have now the
honour to transmit in answer to that of your Excellency, with which I
accompanied my above-mentioned letters to the Consuls of Paraguay.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to express to your Excellency my perfect
satisfaction in regard to the conduct of the escort, generally and
individually, during the whole time that we have journeyed together. I
am perfectly well aware, Excellent Sir, that such a declaration is
unnecessary on my part, being confident that soldiers chosen by your
Excellency for any service, would necessarily act as these have done,
but I should neither satisfy my grateful feeling nor my duty, did I
not state that in fulfilling their commission, both the escort and the
officer that accompanied me from Monte Video, have, in every occasion
and in all circumstances, been constantly active, obedient and ready
to exert themselves to the utmost, and that in no instance have they
given cause of complaint, either to myself or to the parties at whose
houses we have stayed, or through whose lands we have passed.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without calling the attention of your Excellency to
the case of the soldier Jos&eacute; Arillu and to that of the coachman
Antonio, both of whom have been seriously hurt in the service just
completed: at present I can do no more than to recommend them to the
consideration of your Excellency, but I purpose communicating the
affair to my Government.</p>

<p>Repeating my sincere thanks, and saluting your Excellency with the
expression of my highest esteem and most distinguished consideration,
I have the honour to subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="center">Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p>The undersigned supreme Government has received the estimable note of
his Excellency the President of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay,
dated the 1st of August last, informing this Government of the visit
of George J. R. Gordon, Esq., and his companion recommended by his

purpose indicated; and will correspond, in acting upon it, to the
sentiments of friendship by which it is animated towards the
Government of the Oriental Republic.</p>

<p>The Government has disposed that the escort given by his Excellency to
Mr. Gordon, shall be provided with the proper passport for his return,
as it is a duty incumbent on this Government to give due fulfilment to
the necessary attentions on Mr. Gordon's leaving the country.</p>

<p>The request of his Excellency being satisfied in all respects this
Government repeats its expression of true friendship and esteem and
affectionately salutes his Excellency.</p>

<h4>STEAM NAVIGATION ON THE RIVERS OF THE REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY.<br />
(OFFICIAL.)</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Senate and Chamber of Representatives of the Oriental
Republic of the Uruguay, united in General Assembly, have
resolved on the following</i></p></div>

<h4>DECREE.</h4>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;It is granted to Mr. John Halton Buggeln to hold
the exclusive privilege of navigating with ships propelled by
steam or other mechanical power, in the ports and on the rivers
of the Republic, during the period of twelve years from the
time of the arrival of those ships at the port of Monte Video,
under the conditions and restrictions to be expressed in the following
articles; reckoning the arrival of the first steam-vessel
at twenty months after the sanction of this project, save in case
of unforeseen impediment, and the contractor obliging himself
to prove his inculpableness by publishing the privilege in England
and soliciting the advance of the requisite capital; if in
thirty months from the date mentioned in the sanction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
project, he shall not have verified that justification before the
Executive, Mr. Halton Buggeln shall incur the penalty of a fine
of 10,000 dollars to the public treasury, the same to be guaranteed
by his person and goods.</p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;Vessels of the said description of less than fifty tons
burthen, are not comprehended in the exclusion of this privilege.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;The undertaking shall be commenced by two vessels of three
hundred or more tons, and one hundred horse power. The latest
discoveries that shall have been made both for the acceleration of
speed and for the prevention of accidents of explosion or others, are
to be applied to their construction and machinery.</p>

<p>Art. 4.&mdash;The vessels of this undertaking shall convey, free of all
charge, the mails of the Republic to and from all the ports of their
transit; the captains or masters being responsible for their safety,
unless the Government shall appoint a person for this object.</p>

<p>Art. 5.&mdash;Each vessel shall maintain on board two young Oriental
citizens as apprentices to instruct them as engineers and pilots.</p>

<p>Art. 6.&mdash;The vessels of this undertaking shall navigate free of all
tonnage dues, under the British flag, having liberty to deposit on
shore or on board of hulks, such coals, machinery or other matters
intended for use and consumption on board, not including provisions,
the Executive to determine the measures necessary to prevent the abuse
of this liberty, and it being understood that the said deposits shall
not be entitled to any other guarantee than such as belong to foreign
property on shore.</p>

<p>Art. 7&mdash;Whatever may be the state of the relations of this Republic
with Great Britain, this undertaking, its funds and property, and the
men employed in it, shall never under any pretext be an object of
sequestration, indemnification, nor guarantee of any kind of
reclamations or reprisals, which may occur between the two nations,
but rather during the whole term of the contract until its
dissolution, it shall be under the protection of the laws as if such
misunderstandings did not exist; but the navigation may be temporally
suspended and with it the term of the privilege, if the defence of the
Republic or other similar interests should so require.</p>

<p>Art. 8.&mdash;If there should be national contractors or shareholders the
undertaking shall admit them to the number of one third of the shares.</p>

<p>Act. 9&mdash;This privilege shall become of no effect by the voluntary
interruption of its exercise, by the contractor, during a period of
six months continuously.</p>

<p>Art. 10.&mdash;Let it be communicated, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And in making this known to the Executive Power, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> undersigned
President takes the opportunity of saluting the Executive with his
most distinguished consideration.</p>
